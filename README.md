## Covid 19 Data Exploration 

Data is taken from here: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

The vizualisation of results is done via dashboards in Tableau: 
https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/janerek/viz/Covid_Global_Data/Dashboard1

The original data file is split into two parts, one of them contains info about deaths and another - about vaccinations.
This is done to practice joins .

The project contains 2 SQL files:

1. [Covid data analysis with SQL](https://github.com/JaneRek/Covid-Data-Analysis-with-SQL-and-Tableau/blob/main/Covid%20data%20analysis%20with%20SQL.sql) file contains SQL queries that involve different skills: 
      Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types
 
2. [QueriesForTableau](https://github.com/JaneRek/Covid-Data-Analysis-with-SQL-and-Tableau/blob/main/QueriesForTableau.sql) file contains SQL queries for visualization purposes.
